/** @file Clustering.h
 *  @brief This file include all the header files of the project Clustering.
 *
 *  @defgroup Clustering Clustering using generative models
 *  @brief The project Clustering proposes classes for modeling and estimating
 *  generative mixture model.
 *
 *  The aim of this project is to define Interface and specialized classes
 *  in order to manipulate and estimate the parameters of any kind of
 *  generative mixture model.
 *
 *  In statistics, a mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing
 *  the presence of subpopulations within an overall population, without
 *  requiring that an observed data-set should identify the sub-population to
 *  which an individual observation belongs. Formally a mixture model
 *  corresponds to the mixture distribution that represents the probability
 *  distribution of observations in the overall population. However, while
 *  problems associated with "mixture distributions" relate to deriving the
 *  properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations,
 *  "mixture models" are used to make statistical inferences about the
 *  properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled
 *  population, without sub-population-identity information.
 *
 *  Some ways of implementing mixture models involve steps that attribute
 *  postulated sub-population-identities to individual observations (or weights
 *  towards such sub-populations), in which case these can be regarded as types
 *  of unsupervised learning or clustering procedures. However not all inference
 *  procedures involve such steps.
